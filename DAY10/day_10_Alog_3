3. Write a program to Implement ”Selection Sort” using Recursion for given elements 
(Number elements will vary, so make it as configurable item)
How Selection sort works is explained below.

ALGORITHM:
1)Instalize the array and variables.
2)Read the inputs.
3)Search for the min element then check the if condition and swap the number.
4)check with another number and repeat the process.
5)check the result.
