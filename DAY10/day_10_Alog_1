1. Write a function to store "G_Eng_EngineTemperature_uchar" and "G_Eng_EngineRpm_uint" into " G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[5u]" as shown below.
unsigned char G_Eng_EngineTemperature_uchar = 50u ;
unsigned int G_Eng_EngineRpm_uint = 1000u;
unsigned char G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[5u];

ALGRORITHM
1)Instalize the unsigned character and variable and array size of 5.
2)Read the inputs
3)Check the bits in EngineTemperature and EngineRpm.
4)In EngineRPM  9 to 12 bits are assign for array of 0 
5)In EngineRPM  1 to 8 bits are assign for array of 1
6)In EngineRPM  0 th bit is assign for array of 2
7)In EngineTemperature 0 to 7 bits are assign for array of 3
8)print the EngineTemperature and EngineRpm.
