I). Write program to set (1) bits CIS, C2OUT, C1OUT in register “CMCON” if bits CHS3
, CHS2, CHS1 bits are set to 0x06 in register “ADCON0”

ALGORITHM:
1)Instalise the character variable.
2)Declare the value for the varable.
3)To set register do right 2times should be equal to this bits CHS3, 
CHS2, CHS1, CHS0 bits are set to 0x06 in register “ADCON0”
4)Then do 1 left shift with there position(3,6,7)times. so this bits are in set condition.
5)print the output.
