3 Assume that we have a car with 8 seats, and we are monitoring 8 seat belt status 
in a variable “G_Msg_switchstatus_Byte[]” as shown in pic1. Each switch status is 
combination of 2 bits as shown in pic2.
Write status of switches into variable “G_Msg_switchstatus_Byte[]” as below.
SWITCH1, SWITCH7 status is “faulty type 1 in switch”, SWITCH2, SWITCH5 status is 
”switch unbuckle”, SWITCH3, SWITCH6 status is “switch buckle”, SWITCH4, SWITCH0 
status is “faulty type 2 in switch” without disturbing the other bits.


ALGORITHM:
1)Instalize the registers as show in the diagram.
2)Read the inputs.
3)Here We are using switch condition to print the cases.
4)Each case we are taking the for loop to check register until the loop condition fail.
5)Repeat the steps for every register and every case.
6)Check the output for every register and every case.
