3. Set the register T0CON value such a way that bit TMR0ON and PSA bit are set (1), without disturbing the other bits.
II). Find out the value of T0PS2, T0PS1, T0PS0 bits in T0CON register if the value of the register is 0xF3


ALGORITHM:
1)Instalise the character and variable.
2)Read the inputs.
3)TMROON and PSA to set position  ((1<<3)|(1<<7)) we get the frist output.
4)T0PS2, T0PS1, T0PS0 bits in T0CON register if the value of the register is 0xF3. then set this register 
 (n2>>2)&1,(n2>>1)&1,(n2>>0)&1) to get the output.
5)Then do right shift with above register so this bits are in set condition.
6)check the output.
