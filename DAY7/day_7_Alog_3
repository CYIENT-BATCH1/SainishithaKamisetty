3. Write program to clear(0) bits CIS, CM2, CM1, CM0 in register “CMCON” if bits CHS3, 
CHS2, CHS1, CHS0 bits are set to 0x07 in register “ADCON0”

ALGORITHM:

1)Read the data of CMCON and ADCONO.
3)clear the  bits CIS, CM2, CM1, CM0 in register “CMCON” 
3)To clear the bits do right 2times are set the register value 0x07 in register “ADCON0” CHS3,CHS2, CHS1, CHS0.
4)Then do right shift with above register so this bits are in clear condition.
