1. Write a program to do binary search in a sorted array. Program should take input of sorted values and search value. 
(Make number of elements as configurable value)
How binary search works is explained below.
  
ALOGRITHM
1)Instalize the variables
2)Read the inputs
3)set low= starting position(x) and high =ending position(n-1)
4)set the mid=(low+high)/2 to find mid term
5)If array of mid is lessthan means low=mid+1 it will search for left half
6)If array of mid is greaterthan means high=mid-1 it will search for right half
7)if the result is zero print element is not found.
